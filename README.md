# PactumJS x Postman

This project demonstrates **API testing using PactumJS**, inspired by **Postman workflows** performed on "learningPostman" repo , with a focus on **automation, chaining requests, and reusable test logic**.

It is designed to show how Postman-style API testing can be translated into **code-first, scalable API tests** using **Node.js + PactumJS**.

As of 28-01-2026 , CoffeeHouseAPI run is pending as the API server is down
